# rrkm-sum-and-density

This code demonstrates the calculation of the "sum of states" and the "density of states" for a simple molecule with "three vibrational modes". It shows two methods of "exact counting" of the states:
1. Brute Force Counting  
2. Beyer-Swinehart Algorithm

Note for a reader: This code is not one of the most efficient code in the world. It is intentionally kept simple, so that readers can clearly see how the sum as well as density of 
state counting works in an RRKM rate calculation. The purpose is to learn the logic by hand (and then through code), not to build a production-level tool. One can add more 
vibrational modes, optimize the algorithms, or even extend the methods for larger systems.
